# Abra Assessment

The theme block embedded code is located under abra-discounts-extension. I have organized it this way to enable code compilation.

If you need to recompile the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the abra-discounts-extension folder.
2. Run npm i to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Execute npm run build to build the code using webpack.
